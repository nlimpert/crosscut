The aim of this guideline is to achieve a shared understanding of the stylistic
techniques and teaching concepts used. These are intended to support the flow of
reading, make the author's argumentation comprehensible, and enable the reader
to quickly achieve an overview and find important information. The reader is
prepared for working with the offered material.

   Guideline
      The guideline helps readers and authors to communicate in the same way.

.. internal:: It is particularly important to offer a uniform teaching format
   that does never confuse the reader or the course participant. The process of
   creating high-quality teaching material begins with the "right" usage of a
   version-control system, which we want to start with. It is important that
   *every change to the material is documented, reviewed and tested several
   times*.

   A second factor for high-quality material is *stylistic consistency*. A small
   deviation may confuse the reader and disturbs the reading flow. It may also
   be difficult for the reader to keep track of too many rules. The principle
   should always be "as little as possible, as much as necessary".

   The third and maybe most important factor is *content consistency*. A guided
   thread in every course is desirable, but it isn't the only crucial concern.
   Each time someone reads one page, they also build up an expectation attitude
   that is transferred to the other teaching materials. We should always try to
   satisfy these expectations.

   Other factors are the existence of a conclusion of each topic and to avoid
   frequently switching between topics. One last factor is the *retrievability*
   of materials. A course participant will forget things, one more, the other
   less. Instead of repeating things over and over again, a *high level of
   referencing* is what we aim for. This should make it possible to read quickly
   because we will not constantly mention what the reader could already know.
   Experienced users will no longer be bored with familiar topics and in
   addition the teaching materials will remain maintainable and exchangeable.
