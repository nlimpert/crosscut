The changes to the training material, developed software, and other by-products
are collated for each release. Usually, the change log is updated at the end of
a milestone merge. Since the main outcome of this project is not a software
product, old releases are not maintained as usual. However, if a "hotfix" is
applied to the master branch, it must be noted separately in the change log.

For normal releases, a total of up to four lists are generated:

```markdown
## r.42

Here should be a short summary of the goals of this release.

### Added

- What was added in this release?

### Changed

- What was changed compared to the last release?

### Deprecated

- What was marked to be removed in one of the next releases?

### Removed

- What was removed in this release?
```

For a "hotfix", only one lists is made:

```markdown
## r.42-a

- What does the hotfix do?
```

New entries in the changelog are always added at the top.
