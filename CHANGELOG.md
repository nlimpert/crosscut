The changes to the training material, developed software and other secondary
products are collated for each release. Usually, the change log is updated at
the end of a milestone merge. Since the main outcome of this project is not a
software product, old releases are not maintained as usual. However, if a
"hotfix" is applied to the master branch, it must be noted separately in the
change log.

For normal releases, a total of up to four lists are generated:

```markdown
## r.42

Here should be a short summary of the goals of this release.

### Added

- What was added to the project in terms of content? Were the developed software
  or other secondary products extended?

### Changed

- Were existing content, developed software or other secondary products changed?

### Deprecated

- Were existing content, developed software or other secondary products marked
  to be removed in the next release?

### Removed

- What was removed from the project in terms of content? Were the developed
  software or other secondary products extended?
```

For a "hotfix", only one enumeration is made:

```markdown
## r.42-a

- What does the hotfix do?
```

New entries in the changelog are always added at the top.
