All content authors and code developers are allowed to enlist themselves as
contributors in

1. the `CONTRIBUTORS.md` with the format rules specified below,
2. the `contributors.rst` with the format rules provided there,
3. all `.rst` files that they modified, in a term-role-based, chronological, and
   semicolon-separated manner within the `sectionauthor` directive,
4. and all `.py` files that they modified, with surname first, forename second,
   and in a chronological and semicolon-separated manner within the `__author__`
   variable,

as long as their changes are *noteworthy*.

For the `CONTRIBUTORS.md` the authors have to be sorted by their surname first,
then by their forename. Entries for alumni maintainers and leaders have to be
crossed out and moved to the end of the list. Always use the following code
format for new entries in the `CONTRIBUTORS.md`.

```markdown
- [Doe, John](mailto:john.doe@example.com)
- ~~[Doe, Jane](mailto:jane.doe@example.com)~~
```
